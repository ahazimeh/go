done := make(chan bool)
go greet("Nice to meet you!",done)
go greet("How are you?",done)
go slowGreet("How ... are ... you ...?", done)
go greet("I hope you're liking the course!",done)
<- done
<- done
<- done
<- done
// and in the function
  doneChan <- true

alternatively:
  dones := make([]chan bool, 4)

  dones[0] = make(chan bool)
	go greet("Nice to meet you!",dones[0])
  dones[1] = make(chan bool)
	go greet("How are you?",dones[1])
  dones[2] = make(chan bool)
	go slowGreet("How ... are ... you ...?", dones[2])
  dones[3] = make(chan bool)
	go greet("I hope you're liking the course!",dones[3])

  for _,done := range dones {
    <-done
  }

alternatively: you can use the first approach again and do this
  for range done {
  }
  and on the longest operation run close(doneChan)
